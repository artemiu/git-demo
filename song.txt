Die, die, die my darling 
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth

I'll be seeing you again
Yeah, I'll be seeing you, in hell
11

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself
Longing for change
And in the bad times I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
We're far from the shallow now.....
